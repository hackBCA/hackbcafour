        <h2>What is a hackathon?</h2>
        <h3>A hackathon is an overnight coding event in which teams spend the weekend “hacking” together to create an awesome project such as a game, website, or app! Hackathons are also a place to meet new people and even make a project with new people. If someone is new to coding, there are many workshops available to learn how to code or to learn a new programming language.</h3>
